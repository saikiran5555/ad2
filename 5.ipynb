    "In DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), the algorithm identifies three types of points: core points, border points, and noise points. Here's how they differ and their relationship to anomaly detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Core Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Core points are data points that have at least a specified minimum number of neighboring points (defined by the parameter minPts) within a specified distance (defined by the parameter epsilon).\n",
    "These points are located in dense regions of the dataset, indicating areas where there are a sufficient number of nearby points.\n",
    "Core points typically belong to clusters and serve as the starting points for cluster formation in DBSCAN.\n",
    "Border Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Border points are data points that lie within the epsilon distance of a core point but do not have enough neighbors to be considered core points themselves.\n",
    "These points are located at the periphery of clusters and are considered part of the cluster but are not central to its formation.\n",
    "Border points can be thought of as transitional points between clusters and noise points.\n",
    "Noise Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise points, also known as outliers, are data points that do not meet the criteria to be considered core points or border points.\n",
    "These points are typically isolated or lie in low-density regions of the dataset.\n",
    "Noise points do not belong to any cluster and are often considered anomalies or irrelevant data.\n",
    "Relation to Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Core points and border points are typically associated with normal behavior or typical patterns in the data. They represent regions of high density where most data points reside.\n",
    "Noise points, on the other hand, are often considered anomalies or outliers. They represent data points that do not conform to the dense regions identified by the clustering algorithm.\n",
    "Anomaly detection can be performed by considering noise points as anomalies or by using additional criteria to identify outliers among core and border points. The density-based nature of DBSCAN makes it well-suited for anomaly detection tasks, as anomalies are often characterized by their deviation from dense regions in the feature space. By considering noise points or points on the fringes of clusters, DBSCAN can effectively identify anomalies in the data.\n",
