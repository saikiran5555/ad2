    "The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm is a popular technique for detecting local outliers within a dataset. Unlike global outlier detection methods that consider outliers in the context of the entire dataset, LOF identifies anomalies based on their local density compared to their neighbors. Here's how LOF detects local outliers:\n",

    "Local Density Estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    "LOF first computes the local density of each data point by measuring the density of its neighborhood. The density is typically estimated using distance-based methods such as k-nearest neighbors (kNN). A point with a high density has many neighbors nearby, while a point with a low density has few neighbors in its vicinity.\n",
    "Local Reachability Density:\n",
    "\n",
    "After estimating the local density of each point, LOF computes the local reachability density for each point. This is done by comparing the density of a point with the densities of its neighbors. The local reachability density of a point is the inverse of the average density of its k-nearest neighbors.\n",
    "Local Outlier Factor (LOF) Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, LOF calculates the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for each data point. The LOF of a point measures how much its density deviates from the density of its neighbors. Points with an LOF significantly higher than 1 are considered local outliers, indicating that they have a lower density compared to their neighbors. The LOF is computed as the average ratio of the local reachability densities of a point and its neighbors."
