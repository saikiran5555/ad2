    "How DBSCAN Detects Anomalies:\n",
    "Density-Based Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN identifies dense regions in the data space and marks points that lie in low-density regions as anomalies.\n",
    "It distinguishes between core points (points within dense regions), border points (points on the border of dense regions), and noise points (points that are neither core nor border points).\n",
    "Core Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "A core point is a point that has at least \n",
    "minPts\n",
    "minPts points (including itself) within a distance of \n",
    "�\n",
    "ε. These points lie within dense regions.\n",
    "Border Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "A border point is a point that has fewer than \n",
    "minPts\n",
    "minPts points within \n",
    "�\n",
    "ε but is reachable from a core point. These points lie on the border of dense regions.\n",
    "Noise Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise points are points that are neither core nor border points. They do not have enough neighboring points within \n",
    "�\n",
    "ε to be considered part of a dense region.\n",
    "Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Points that are labeled as noise points by DBSCAN are often considered anomalies. These points are typically isolated from dense regions and do not fit well into any cluster.\n",
    "Key Parameters Involved:\n",
    "Epsilon (\n",
    "�\n",
    "ε):\n",
    "\n",
    "Also known as the \"neighborhood radius.\" It defines the maximum distance between two points for them to be considered as neighbors. Points within this distance are considered to be in the same neighborhood.\n",
    "MinPts:\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum number of points required to form a dense region (including the point itself). Points with at least \n",
    "minPts\n",
    "minPts neighbors within \n",
    "�\n",
    "ε are considered core points.\n",
    "Distance Metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance) influences how distances between points are calculated, which in turn affects how dense regions are defined.\n",
    "Algorithm Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are variations of DBSCAN, such as OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure), which offer improvements and different approaches to detecting anomalies.\n",
    "Anomaly Detection with DBSCAN:\n",
    "Anomalies are typically identified as noise points by DBSCAN. These are points that fall outside of dense regions and do not fit well into any cluster.\n",
    "Adjusting the epsilon and minPts parameters allows for fine-tuning the sensitivity of DBSCAN to anomalies. Smaller values of epsilon and larger values of minPts may result in more conservative anomaly detection, whereas larger values of epsilon and smaller values of minPts may lead to a more lenient approach, potentially identifying more points as anomalies."
